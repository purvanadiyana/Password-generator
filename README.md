Password Generator
This is a simple Python script for generating random, secure passwords. It allows the user to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.

Features:
Customizable Length: You choose the exact quantity of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Two Generation Levels: Easy Level (Ordered): Generates a password where components are grouped (e.g., all letters first, then all symbols).
                       Moderate Level (Shuffled): Generates components into a list and then uses random.shuffle() to create a much stronger, randomized password order

How to Run:
Save the code---> Save the provided code as a Python file (e.g., password_generator.py).

example output:
welcome to the password generator
how many letters would you like in your password?
3
How many symbols would you like?
4

2
easy level output:
osq@$6225
moderate level output:

['7', 'h', 'm', '#', 't', '%', '7', '5', '9']
